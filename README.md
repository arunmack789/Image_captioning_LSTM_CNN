 #LSTM 
 Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture  used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition  and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDSs (intrusion detection systems)

#I used pretrained cnn model  inception V3
Inceptionv3[1] is a convolutional neural network for assisting in image analysis and object detection, and got its start as a module for Googlenet. It is the third edition of Google's Inception Convolutional Neural Network, originally introduced during the ImageNet Recognition Challenge. Just as ImageNet can be thought of as a database of classified visual objects, Inception helps classification of objects[2] in the world of computer vision. One such use is in life sciences, where it aids in the research of Leukemia.[3] The original name (Inception) was codenamed this way after a popular "'we need to go deeper' internet meme" went viral, quoting a phrase from Inception film of Christopher Nolan
